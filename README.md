# Coursera_Capstone
###Capstone assignment
## Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. 
Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

**Business Problem**
Travel companies are always in a search to provide best services in order to charge good amount of money to the customers by taking them to the particular food joints they have tie-ups with. Now this does not necessarily mean that those food joints serve the best variational food. To simply put it, local people know more(better) about the place/neighborhood food than the travel agency "claim to know". So the problem is how to determine these places in the neighborhood?

## Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. 
Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.
This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

**Actions on the data collected**
Now, similar to google maps we will be able to narrow down restaurants by comparing their rating to be precise as the reviews given by people who have visited the place determine how good a food place is.
Data will be collected from Italy.This project would use Foursquare API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.

**For this project we will consider the following certeria's:**
1. Name and area of the joint
2. Type of food served
3. Ratings given by consumers

This project will help the travellers or food critics(foodies) in general to understand which places are recommended by the people from their personal experience!
